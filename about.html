        <center><h3>About Odin!</h3></center>

Odin and his two sisters were originally found as strays in Northern California and brought to an Oregon Humane society when they were ~14
 weeks old. No one knows what breeds they are, but many people guessed part pitbull because of the brindle coat.
<p>
As Odin got older, he grew tall and lean and weighs 70lbs. Now people guess that he's part Shepherd / Great Dane.
<p>
Either way, Odin has grown to be an amazing dog who loves to learn new tricks, loves his family and an all around great dog.
<P>
Special thanks to Tab Shamsi of Training Positive for the incredibly helpful Youtube video's he published on positive dog training techniques.<br>
